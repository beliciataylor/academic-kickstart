I am a rising senior at Emory College of Arts & Sciences majoring in Economics and Mathematics with an English minor. I am seeking a research assistant job, and I aim to earn a PhD in Economics. I am interested in doing public economics research. I'm currently a research assistant working on a project using machine learning techniques and natural language processing in Python.
