title: The State of Low Income America -- Credit Access & Debt Repayment
summary: _New York Fed Research and Community Development joint report_ (March 2023). In this report, we examine low-income householdsâ€™ ability to access and keep current on debt obligations during the pandemic and recovery. Government fiscal transfers to households and significant government-mandated and private-sector debt relief during the pandemic have alleviated economic hardship for millions of Americans. With fiscal relief and debt-related moratoria waning, this report examines current debt holdings across income groups and points to indicators we intend to monitor throughout 2022.
