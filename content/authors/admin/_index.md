**My name is Belicia Rodriguez, and I'm a college student at Emory University interested in Economics and Data Science.**

I'm currently a Research Assistant in the Emory Economics department, where I'm collaborating on a project that analyzes co-authorship networks with traditional social network methods and natural language processing. When I'm not busy with a research project or coursework, I can be found knitting a new pattern, reading a book from my growing to-reads list, or working on my economics and data science blog.
