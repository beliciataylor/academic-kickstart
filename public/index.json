We examine the effect of undiagnosed memory disorders on credit outcomes using nationally representative credit reporting data merged with Medicare data. Years prior to eventual diagnosis, average credit scores begin to weaken and payment delinquency begins to increase, overall and for mortgage and credit card accounts specifically. Credit outcomes consistently deteriorate over the quarters leading up to diagnosis. The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis of a memory disorder. Our findings substantiate the possible utility of credit reporting data for facilitating early identification of those at risk for memory disorders.","tags":["New York Fed"],"title":"The Financial Consequences of Undiagnosed Memory Disorders","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1707609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707609600,"objectID":"943dbeb98e487cff4a66b08fe739e283","permalink":"https://beliciataylor.github.io/project/emory-readability/","publishdate":"2024-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/emory-readability/","section":"project","summary":"_Economics Letters_ (Feb 2024). Readability is a measure of how easy it is to read a text. Over time, general-interest journals have become more technical. This affects how accessible research is to a general audience. Our analysis looks at how readable abstracts are. We study the readability of abstracts of top five economics journals between 2000–2019. We collect the characteristics of the abstracts, papers, and authors of these papers. We find that abstracts with higher proportion of women co-authors are more readable. These results are robust to various readability measures and model specifications.","tags":["Undergraduate"],"title":"Abstract Readability: Evidence from Top-5 Economics Journals","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705536000,"objectID":"770f4562073f6e7c110e248db9fb2a9f","permalink":"https://beliciataylor.github.io/project/nyfed-solia-2024/","publishdate":"2024-01-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nyfed-solia-2024/","section":"project","summary":"_New York Fed Research and Community Development joint report_ (Jan 2024).

Low-income debt holders, who tended to have elevated debt delinquency levels prior to the pandemic, saw their delinquency rates – and credit scores – improve; the median credit score for borrowers in low-income areas went from 651 in Q4 2019 to 670 in Q3 2023.This report looks at which groups have fallen behind on debt payments and discuss whether rising delinquencies are concentrated amongst certain groups or broader based","tags":["New York Fed"],"title":"The State of Low Income America -- Credit Access \u0026 Housing","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1699315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699315200,"objectID":"621ba400c1caeb277240f12e8d66712b","permalink":"https://beliciataylor.github.io/project/nyfed-lse-credit-cards/","publishdate":"2023-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nyfed-lse-credit-cards/","section":"project","summary":"_New York Fed Liberty Street Economics_ (Nov 2023).
