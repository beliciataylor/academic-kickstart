I am an Economics PhD student at Duke University. Previously, I was an RA at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where I contributed to academic research and policy briefs on household and consumer finance, the U.S. housing market, climate risk, chronic health conditions, and internet connectivity. My current interest are in housing and public policy.
